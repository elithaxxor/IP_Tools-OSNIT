Your smile warms my heart
You are in my thoughts, always
I crave you more than chocolate
You complete me
Some people are worth waiting for…
You will hold by heart forever
Spending time with you always becomes my favorite day
You are my happy place
I am much more me when I am with you
Now and forever
You make me smile
I miss you when you are not by my side
Home is wherever we are together
We are cute together
We have a love like no other
You are looking good!
L’amour
You make my heart sing
I never meant to fall in love
You take my breath away
I love you more
Love finds a way
I carry you in my heart
I love being with you
I am yours, today and always
You are the puzzle piece that has been missing all along
You warm my heart
I am yours
All I want is your arms around me
I smile whenever I think about you
My luv
ou are always on my mind
Never let me go
Our souls know each other
I crave you more than wine
You make me happy
You spoke to my heart
Your presence is a whisper with me all the time
You are the best thing in my life
You speak to my soul
When I think of our future, I only see you
You are my future
You are everything that I have always wanted
When I met you, everything made sense
Love happens when you are busy living your life
All I need is you
Love found me when I thought it lost my number
I love that you really know me
To be loved, is life’s greatest gift
Knowing you are with me, makes everything better
You are an amazing person
Love finds a way
You are the cherry on my sundae
Every breath you take know that I am with you
Love is patient, Love is kind
You are “the good things” in life
I fall for you all over again, every day
And suddenly everything looks brighter
I love who I am when I am with you
I love that you are my biggest cheerleader
You are always in my dreams
I am so happy that you are mine
You are very lucky, to have me on by your side!
You are “the one”
I carry you with me always
Nothing is worse than being apart
I think of you and smile
Life is a little less difficult because of you
You are the love of my life
I love to laugh with you
You are my best friend
Love stories always happened to someone else, until now…
You make me feel special
Thinking of you and smiling
I will go anywhere with you
The best is yet to be
You are sexy
Hold me tight
I melt a little when I look into your eye
You own my whole heart
You are free to love me
I promise to love you
When I touch you, I feel content
I knew you were trouble when I met you!
Baby, I am so happy that you are mine.
We created something special to build from
This is a beautiful moment in time
Together we can travel the world
You play an incredibly important part in my life
When you are lying next to me, I feel your heart and am happy
I carry you with me, in my heart
This is real love, not movie love but intense passionate love
This is a perfect romantic moment
I cherish these moments
Life is challenging but it’s these small moments that make my soul sing
My wish is for us to go through this life together
When I saw you, I just knew
This is what they mean when they say, “meant to be”
I never want to let you go
love you
